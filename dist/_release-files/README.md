# Bungee

In the crowded urban environment, space for signage is always at a premium. From dumpy liquor stores to majestic theaters, sometimes signs have nowhere to go but up. Bungee is a font family that celebrates urban signage by wrangling the Latin alphabet to work vertically as well as horizontally; with separately glyphs, spacing, and kerning for each orientation. Bungee comes equipped with chromatic inlines, outlines, shades, and ornaments, making it the perfect toolkit to take your text in a new direction.

Bungee is designed by [David Jonathan Ross](http://www.djr.com).
