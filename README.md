# Bungee

In the crowded urban environment, space is always at a premium. From dumpy liquor stores to majestic theaters, sometimes signage has nowhere to go but up. Bungee wrangles the Latin alphabet to work vertically as well as horizontally; with separately glyphs, spacing, and kerning for each orientation. Bungee and comes equipped with chromatic inlines, outlines, shadows, and ornaments, making it the perfect toolkit to take your sign in a new direction.

## Family structure

Bungee contains several different font sets that allow access to the chromatic layers and vertical forms. 

The basic *Bungee* family includes Regular and Hairline weights, as well as three composite layerings: Inline, Outline, and Shade.

*Bungee Layers* contains each layer in a separate font, which all share the same metrics. These fonts can be used in combination to create chromatic text by using layered textboxes in a website or advanced design app.

*Bungee Layers Rotated* implements Bungee’s vertical forms by default, with all characters rotated 90° counterclockwise. These fonts can be set in a textbox rotated 90° clockwise to simulate vertical type.

*Bungee Color* contains experiments with the various color font formats out there, including SVG, COLR/CPAL and sbix. None of these formats are widely supported (yet!), so your milage may vary. These fonts are built with <a href="https://github.com/fontfont/RoboChrome">Robochrome</a>.

In all fonts besides *Bungee Layers Rotated*, Bungee’s vertical forms are accessed via the *vert* and *vpal* OpenType features. These features are activated by vertical typesetting tools in design apps, or in CSS using *--prefix-writing-mode: vertical-rl*.

Bungee was designed in <a href="http://www.robofont.com">RoboFont</a> and its drawing and build sources are available in <a href="http://www.unifiedfontobject.org">UFO format</a>.
