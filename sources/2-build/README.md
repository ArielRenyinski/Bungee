# Bungee

In the crowded urban environment, space is always at a premium. From dumpy liquor stores to majestic theaters, sometimes signage has nowhere to go but up. Bungee wrangles the Latin alphabet to work vertically as well as horizontally; with separately glyphs, spacing, and kerning for each orientation. Bungee and comes equipped with chromatic inlines, outlines, shadows, and ornaments, making it the perfect toolkit to take your sign in a new direction.
